        <p class="About"> <h2> About Margo Shearer </h2> </p>
        <p> I was born Natalia Michelle Shearer in Pennsylvania on April 2nd, 2002. From early times in my childhood, I always loved being creative when it comes to drawing. I started drawing characters from Movies, tv shows, cartoons, and illustraited my own books when I was 7 years old. By the time I was in high school, I got to paint on full fledged canvases. In my freshman and sophomore years of college, I engaged into figure drawing on large sketch books and got introduced to Abobe Illustrator, Indesign, and Character Animator. There were quite a few challenges when it came to work on projects with these projects but its worth a learning experience. I created this Portfolio Gallery, Margo Studio, to share a one of my few past works.</p>
